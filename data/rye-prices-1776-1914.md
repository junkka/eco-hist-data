NOTES: The data is based on so-called market scales that were established on a regular basis in Swedish counties from the early 18th century until well into the 20th century. Market scales represented official prices and were designed to translate tax payments and other government fees paid in kind into a monetary value. Market scales did not represent prices from actual contracts, but were negotiated between taxpayers and receivers of tax on the basis of late December market prices in the region's boroughs. Market price scale assessments were improved as time went by and in 1855 a so-called B-scale reflected cash sales prices that were collected on a monthly basis. 
						
Whether market scales represent "real" prices - whatever the meaning of "real" or "actual" - is a long debated subject. However, after a thorough analysis, Jörberg concluded that market scale prices are fairly accurate representations of market prices. Market scale prices are at least as good as measurements of prices from individual actual transactions.
